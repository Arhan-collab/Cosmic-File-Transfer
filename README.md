Cosmic File Transfer (CFT)

Cosmic File Transfer (CFT) is a lightweight, locally-hosted file-transfer utility built to move files between devices without relying on cloud services or external servers. It runs entirely on your machine using a small Flask backend, making it fast, private, and easy to deploy.

CFT provides a simple web interface where you can upload, download, and manage files on your local network. It supports large files, chunked transfers, and resuming interrupted uploads, so you’re not screwed if your connection blinks. Everything stays on your LAN — no outside communication, no data leaving your system.

CFT is meant for people who want a straightforward, self-hosted file-sharing tool without the bloat, nonsense, or external dependencies.
